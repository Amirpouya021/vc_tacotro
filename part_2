The system claims to be able to imitate the human voice very accurately. This system
is the second generation of this technology offered by Google and consists of 2 deep
neural networks - deep neural networks is the first network that is able to convert text
to spectrogram (PDF) - a visual way to show Audio frequencies over time. In the next
step, the spectrogram is fed with WaveNet. WaveNet is a system developed by
Alphabet's artificial intelligence testing center, this system can read the presented
tables and generate the desired audio elements based on it.
